# Bug Analysis Todo List

## 1. Backend Issues (app.py)

### Critical Issues:
- [ ] **Handle Socket.IO Connection Errors**: Implement proper error handling for Socket.IO connection issues in the `download_model` function.
- [ ] **Fix Race Condition**: Add proper synchronization to the `downloads` dictionary to prevent race conditions during concurrent downloads.
- [ ] **Improve File Path Validation**: Implement robust validation for file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks.

### Performance Issues:
- [ ] **Optimize File Operations**: Convert blocking file operations to asynchronous operations to prevent blocking the event loop.
- [ ] **Reduce Memory Consumption**: Implement streaming file downloads to avoid reading entire files into memory.

## 2. Frontend Issues (script.js)

### Critical Issues:
- [ ] **Enhance Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling for network requests, especially in the form submission handler.
- [ ] **Implement Socket.IO Reconnection**: Add explicit reconnection logic when the Socket.IO connection is lost during downloads.
- [ ] **Fix Memory Leak**: Implement automatic log clearing or periodic cleanup to prevent the logs array from growing indefinitely.

### UI/UX Issues:
- [ ] **Add Progress Persistence**: Implement local storage to persist download progress across page refreshes.
- [ ] **Improve User Feedback**: Add visual feedback for quant pattern validation and other operations.
- [ ] **Fix Responsive Design**: Ensure UI elements display correctly on all device sizes.

## 3. Model Manager Issues (model_manager.js)

### Critical Issues:
- [ ] **Prevent XSS Vulnerabilities**: Implement proper HTML sanitization when inserting model data into the DOM.
- [ ] **Add Input Validation**: Validate search input to prevent performance issues with extremely long search terms.
- [ ] **Improve Error Handling**: Add robust error handling for API calls in update and delete functions.

### Performance Issues:
- [ ] **Optimize DOM Manipulation**: Use more efficient methods for filtering and updating the model list.
- [ ] **Implement Memory Management**: Clear the `allModels` array periodically to prevent memory bloat.

## 4. Template Issues (index.html, model_manager.html)

### Issues:
- [ ] **Update CDN Version**: Make the Socket.IO client version configurable rather than hardcoded.
- [ ] **Fix Script Loading Race Condition**: Implement proper sequencing for loading Socket.IO and application scripts.

## 5. Docker Configuration (docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile)

### Issues:
- [ ] **Improve Security**: Run the container as a non-root user.
- [ ] **Add Resource Limits**: Configure appropriate CPU and memory limits for the container.
- [ ] **Implement Health Checks**: Add health checks to monitor application status.

## 6. General Improvements

- [ ] **Implement Comprehensive Logging**: Add structured logging throughout the application.
- [ ] **Add Unit Tests**: Create test suite for critical components.
- [ ] **Improve Documentation**: Update documentation with security considerations and best practices.
- [ ] **Add Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- [ ] **Implement Proper Configuration Management**: Use environment variables for configuration instead of hardcoded values.
